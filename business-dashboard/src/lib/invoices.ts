 * Single source of truth for "is this invoice overdue?"
 *
 * An invoice is overdue if either:
 *   - its stored Status is explicitly "Overdue" (manual override / future cron), or
 *   - its Status is "Sent" AND it has a Due Date in the past.
 *
 * Phase 6 cron is not implemented; deriving here means a `Sent` invoice that
 * passes its due date surfaces immediately on the dashboard without needing
 * Airtable to be re-tagged.
